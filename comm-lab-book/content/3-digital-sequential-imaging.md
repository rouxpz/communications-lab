## Digital Imaging

### What is digital imaging?

It's easy to think of digital imaging as a field that didn't exist before everyone had access to Photoshop on their computers, but we're going to take a much broader look at the idea. For our purposes, **digital imaging** can be defined as the creation or manipulation of imagery with technology.

Digital imaging has been around since long before every desk had a computer on it. In fact, photo manipulation has been around since not long after the first developments of photography itself. One of the earliest known examples of photo manipulation happened in the 1860s, when a portrait of President Abraham Lincoln began circulating.

This well-known photo was later revealed to have been a composite image, created by superimposing Lincoln's head onto the body of John C. Calhoun, a political rival.

As Photoshop became more and more popular as a tool to easily enable photographers and editors to manipulate content, the verb "photoshopping" started to become commonplace, as shorthand for the process of photo manipulation. Over the years, it has acquired a relatively negative context, because it is most often used alongside the process of retouching or changing a model or celebrity's natural appearance in exchange for a more "print-friendly" image.

Image manipulation can be used as an art form in and of itself.

### The Technical Stuff

With the advent of personal computing, and as computing and graphics technology has become more and more advanced, it's become much easier than it used to be to work with photography and imagery. There's now lots of software out there that enable us to create and manipulate digital images ourselves.

One of the most popular tools for this work is [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), part of the Adobe Creative Suite. Photoshop is the industry standard for working with digital imagery, but there are also quite a few alternatives, such as [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), XX, and XX. This text will not go into detail about the software and how to use it, but as you start learning the specifics of whatever platform you use, there are some universal principles surrounding digital imagery that will apply no matter what tool you decide to use to create your projects.

There are two types of digital images that are commonly used on the Web: bitmap images and vector images. **Bitmap images** (otherwise known as **rasterized images**), are drawn according to color values of pixels in an image. Lines and shapes in space cannot be manipulated directly; instead, in order to change the content of a bitmap image, you have to change the color values of each individual pixel.

By contrast, **vector images** are drawn using references to lines, shapes, and color. Lines and shapes can be manipulated and changed by adjusting points in space. This allows for greater flexibility in resizing and otherwise changing imagery; because the image is not tied down to having specific pixels colored a specific way, it is much easier to manipulate and scale vector imagery.

Generally, when we talk about manipulating photos, we are talking about working with bitmap images and pixels. If you're interested in creating your own illustration and drawings, you will most likely work with vector imagery. Some software programs that are used to create and edit vector images are Adobe Illustrator, XX, and XX.

**Resolution** is the number of pixels that are used to create an image. The more pixels the image contains, the larger and clearer the image will be. However, higher resolution images tend to be much, much larger in file size, so please keep this in mind before you upload any high resolution images to your sites (anything greater than 1280 pixels wide and 720 pixels high).

Because bitmap images are created by coloring a specific number of pixels in, confined to a specifically sized grid or area, it's generally harder to resize these images -- in particular, it gets difficult to make them larger than their original dimensions. If you have ever tried to take a small photo and resize it to a much larger scale, you may have noticed that the image will resize, but it will become extremely pixelated. This is because the image was created with a built-in maximum size and number of pixels. If that size is increased, the image compensates for the additional pixels by multiplying their colors to the degree that the image is stretched, since it's impossible to generate new pixels in the image on the fly.

There are a variety of file types that you can use to save your images. (Examples of the same image in all of these formats)
**JPG or JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)**: Turns images into rasterized (bitmap) images. If the image has layers, it will flatten all the layers into one plane before saving. This file format is known as a *lossy* format, meaning that some data is lost in compression. The final saved image will be of a lower quality than the pieces used to create it.
**PNG (Portable Network Graphic)**: PNG files are very popular for the Internet, specifically because they support transparency. Developed to build upon the capabilities of the GIF. Also rasterized graphics. Lossless (no data lost in compression).
GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) - Limited to 256 bits of color data. Supports animation.
PSD (Photoshop Document) - Retains layers and keeps ability to edit. Use this for works-in-progress ONLY.
Explain existence of different software that you can use to create and manipulate images.

## Comics & Sequential Art

Sequential Art: an art form that uses images in sequence to convey information.
[Kuleshov effect video]
Kuleshov effect - you make inferences based on two images placed next to each other.
In comics, the gutter (the space between panels) does the same thing -- represents that inference that the user makes when the imagery is still and all on one plane. It’s the logical leap that we are required to, and always do, make in order to extract meaning from two images placed next to each other.
The idea of using time and sequence to tell a story or communicate a message is foundational to the concepts we are covering in this book.

### History of Sequential Imagery

Chauvet cave paintings - some scholars believe there might have been an underlying ritualistic or shamanistic meaning to these

Heiroglyphics - the Book of the Dead for Ani, 1250 BCE - not only are the images on top representative of a sequential story, but the heiroglyphics themselves are as well.

Trajan’s Column - ancient Rome, 113 AD - commemorates Roman Emperor Trajan’s victory in the Dacian Wars

Bayeux Tapestry - England, 1066 - events leading up to the Norman conquest of England

Mayan codices - folded books of Mayan drawings - mostly destroyed by the Spanish in 1562

Mahabharat shield - 19th century (Albert Hall Museum, Jaipur).

William Hogarth “A Rake’s Progress” - printed sequential narrative - taken together, they tell one overarching story of the decline of an heir’s son in London. The complete story doesn’t come through unless all the prints are read together in sequence.

Muybridge - interested in the idea of motion as a visual sequence. Starts recording moving objects with multiple cameras in order to break down fluid movement into frames or stills.

Rodolphe Töpffer - Swiss artist in 1830s - combined panels, words, and illustrations to create what we recognize as the first “comic.”

The Yellow Kid -- first regular comic strip from 1895-1898. Social commentary on class and race in New York.

Krazy Kat by George Herriman - ran from 1913-1944. One of the most influential strips that set a lot of standards for how we look at comics now.

Comics are often thought of as humorous, relatively simplistic. This is “Blondie”, one of the longest running comic strips in American newspapers. Utilized tropes and stereotypes familiar to the audience from popular culture

However, comic strips have evolved a broad range of styles even while being constrained to the same format. Judge Parker & soap opera style comics.

One of my personal favorites is Calvin and Hobbes. Watterson eventually played with the format, at times eliminating panels altogether and really toying with the standard for comic strips as we know them.

Superhero comics -- I’m betting this is what most of you thought of when you thought of “comics”. Left to right: Batman, Superman, Avengers.

Over the years the visual style has evolved. Right to left: Ms. Marvel, X-Men, Avengers.

Manga - Astro Boy is a hugely popular example - comics creating their own aesthetic style and storytelling characteristics in Japan post-WWII

More manga examples - again style has evolved in a lot of ways to reflect societal and cultural trends and attitudes [MORE DETAIL]

Political cartoons -- often known for being single panel drawings, but sometimes they will use multiple panels in order to emphasize passage of time, contrast, etc.

Comics don’t have to be fictional. These are two examples of comics that accomplish a sequential narrative -- instructional, in both cases -- while being nonfiction.

Art Spiegelman’s Maus -- brought independent comics to the mainstream, leading to the term “graphic novel” and the appreciation for comics as somewhat of a “higher” art form in certain contexts.

As comics have evolved, certain artists have elevated the genre into an art form that can be appreciated for its own merits and by a broader audience. Frank Miller - known for combining elements of film noir and manga in his work.

Watchmen (1985) by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons -- a commentary on the superhero genre, the Cold War, and politics. Takes a much more serious and darker approach to comics.

Autobiographical comics, comics as memoir:
American Splendor - autobiographical comic by Harvey Pekar, art by a variety of artists.
Persepolis - autobiographical, Marjane Satrapi -- life in Iran
Fun Home -- autobiographical, Alison Bechdel -- explores issues such as family, relationships, sexuality

### Web Comics as an Art Form

Comics on the Internet. The Oatmeal
Dinosaur Comics by Ryan North
A Softer World
Alien Loves Predator - Bernie Hou. Alien vs. Predator meets Odd Couple. Made with action figures and photographs of NYC.
Diesel sweeties - pixel art webcomic
Garfield Minus Garfield
XKCD -- esoteric subject matter; small interactives (https://xkcd.com/1110/)

MS Paint Adventures
Nawlz - utilizes animation and lets the user explore the comic at his or her own pace. FLASH
Murat -- much more subtle in terms of the interaction -- doesn’t give you any explicit clues but instead lets the user explore each panel looking for things to click. FLASH

These Memories Won’t Last - autobiographical comic that makes use of CSS and javascript animation to visually reflect dementia and the idea of memories fading

## Sequential Storytelling Techniques in JavaScript

Because of its purpose in the landscape of the Internet, JavaScript proves to be an extremely useful tool in terms of sequential storytelling and advancing narratives by harnessing user interaction. The following are some examples of techniques that are commonly used by web comic authors and developers to integrate user interaction into their storytelling.
