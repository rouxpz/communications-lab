	<h1>Welcome to Week 2 of Comm Lab!</h1>
	<h3>This week, we're going to be making our pages look better by using CSS.</h3>
	
	<p class="targeted" id="special">I was a little disappointed last week when my HTML page was so dull and boring. <br>
	I wanted to use color and typography and experiment with design, but we hadn't learned about CSS as yet, and so I was left with a very plain page.</p>
	<p class="targeted">Good news, though! Today we're going to begin experimenting with CSS.</p>
